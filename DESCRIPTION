Title: Multi-View Biological Data Analysis
Version: 0.1
Author: Angela Serra
Maintainer: Angela Serra <aserra@unisa.it>
Description: the package contains functions for the analysis of biological data
    multi-view of which you are interested to find subclasses of patients, when
    you have access to the original classes. The analysis approach proposed is
    composed of three stages, one in which we clusters the features to reduce
    its size and find the prototypes for each cluster. One in which you rank
    the prototypes to find the most significant for class separability.One in
    which you clusters patients in each view and then integrate each results in
    a late integration step with different methods.
